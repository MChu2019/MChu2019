🔷 Project Overview & Objectives

        .What it is: An end-to-end data pipeline that collects, cleans, stores, and analyzes job-market data.
                 
        .What we built: Python cleaning functions, schema-aligned transformations, and validation checks.
 
        .Assumptions & limits: API coverage is partial; Kaggle data supplements gaps.

        .My role: Designed data cleaning logic and supported ETL implementation.
        
        .Problem-solving approach: Iterative debugging, reusable functions, and schema-first thinking to ensure data integrity.
